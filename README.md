WeightsCalc with a simple Android UI
I'm learning Android so I'm going to implement my previous WeightsCalc repo with a very basic Android UI.
Perhaps I'll pretty it up later.

v1.0 is now on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.github.laurencemeynell.weightcalculator)!
